# svg-to-react

This directory contains tooling to generate React components from raw SVG icon
files. These images are used for the math-input keypad.

BEWARE: some React component icons were added to the repo without having a .svg
file and so they only exist in the React component in
packages/math-input/src/components/iconography.
